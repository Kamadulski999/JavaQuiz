# Beginning JavaScript Quiz APP

This application consists of a set of 20 introductory JavaScript questions. Upon loading an alert opens that explains the rules. The inital screen contains only a start button that loads the game and starts the timer once clicked. The quiz allows for 100 seconds to answer the 20 questions. The final score is the determined by the number of right answers within the time limit. A missed answer or a skipped question will incur a penalty that reduces the remaining time by 5 seconds. Once complete, the user is given the opportunity to enter their initals and a scoreboard that saves the five highest scores to local storage appears. Clicking the restart button will reload the page and start the game again.
